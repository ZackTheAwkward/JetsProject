# Jets Project
### Description
The object of this project was to read 5 different Jets off a text file, and input
those jets into an ArrayList. From there a menu option was provided to the user,
to allow different inputs from the user. Some of these inputs allowed the user to
obtain a printout of the ArrayList, view the fastest jet, add their own jet, and
the option to remove jets from the list.
### Technologies Used
This project tied in an assortment of different technologies that were taught throughout
the cohort.
- UML
- Buffered Reader/File Reader
- Parsing Data to adapt to different data types
- Use of ArrayList/Lists/Sets/Collections
- Use of Scanner Input from user
- Try/Catch Exceptions to detect user input mismatch and others
- Different types of loops (For/For Each/ While)
- Abstract Classes
- Public/Private data types
- Interfaces
- Implementations of different Classes

### Lessons Learned
This project was a challenge since it tied together a numerous amount of technologies. Most of my struggles came from forgetting how to implement some of these technologies, and a lot of my time was used reviewing course materials to jog my memory. So developing a better note taking system is on my agenda.

Most of my learning came from struggling through the process and overcoming these obstacles. A lot of trial and error was used to test out my code with system outputs. In the future I hope we start to use the debug tool a little bit more to better understand it. When attempting to use it, I found jumping straight to the end of my program, which didn't help find any bugs or better understand how my code was executing.
